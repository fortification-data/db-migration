# Notes

It is important that the current pipeline relies on cleaning!


Let's talk data issues:

- General
  - Floats that should be integers
  - Numbers as numerical when should be categorical strings
  - What are these "comments" everywhere??
  - I think we can generally delete "redcap_repeat_instance" in favor of just using the year
    - Should the year be a key or just in an array?
      - ??^^ **For data stewards** ^^??
  - 

- Urban population
  - Source is the same for all data
  - Data not updated since 2018

- Income Status
  - Source is the same with adjusted year...
    - BUT... reference link is the same?

- Population
  - see above


- Citations
  - ??

- Country
  - Country code is inconsistently applied (i.e. India vs all others)
    - should just use territory flag

- Coverage
  - Should combine all tables and add flag for coverage type
